This is a project for the Senior Capstone Course at Bowie State University (COSC-480). It is a simple implementation of **Node.js** (using express as middleware), **HTML** (front end), and **MySQL** (backend), and presents basic web pages that allow user data to be stored. Future implementations would migrate the local MySQL database to AWSRDS to allow for remote connections. Full instructions can be found in the Instructions.docx file.
